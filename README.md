# Go JS Diagram

An experiment of building a frontend application using golang compiled to WASM, thanks to
[vecty](https://github.com/hexops/vecty).

## Installation

Install [`wasmserve`](https://github.com/hajimehoshi/wasmserve)

```sh
go get -u github.com/hajimehoshi/wasmserve
```

Then, run the application:

```sh
wasmserve
```

The application will be served on <http://localhost:8080/>
